# ✅ Fixed: Authentication & Profile Picture Upload

## What Was Wrong

The previous implementation tried to use server-side authentication in API routes, which doesn't work properly in Next.js with client-side Supabase auth.

## New Solution

**Direct Client-Side Supabase Integration** - All profile operations now happen directly from the client using Supabase SDK. This is the recommended approach and is much simpler!

## Changes Made

### 1. **AuthContext** (`src/components/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Exported `supabase` client for use in other components
- ✅ Added `refreshUser()` function to reload user data after updates
- ✅ This allows direct Supabase operations from any component

### 2. **Profile Page** (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`)
Now all operations use Supabase directly:

#### **Profile Picture Upload:**
```typescript
// Upload file directly to Supabase Storage
await supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload(filePath, file)

// Update user metadata
await supabase.auth.updateUser({
  data: { profile_picture: publicUrl }
})
```

#### **Profile Update:**
```typescript
// Update directly via Supabase
await supabase.auth.updateUser({
  email: newEmail,
  data: { display_name: newName }
})
```

#### **Password Change:**
```typescript
// Verify current password
await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })

// Update password
await supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword })
```

## Required: Supabase Storage Setup

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click on **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New bucket**
4. Set:
   - **Name:** `avatars`
   - **Public:** ✅ YES (check this box)
   - **File size limit:** 5MB (optional)
   - **Allowed MIME types:** image/* (optional)
5. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Set Storage Policies (Recommended)

Go to **Storage** → **Policies** → Click on your `avatars` bucket

Add these policies:

#### Policy 1: Allow Uploads
```sql
-- Name: Users can upload profile pictures
-- Target roles: authenticated
-- Policy: INSERT
-- Expression:
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

#### Policy 2: Allow Public Read
```sql
-- Name: Public can view avatars
-- Target roles: public
-- Policy: SELECT
-- Expression:
CREATE POLICY "Public can view avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

#### Policy 3: Allow Users to Update Their Own
```sql
-- Name: Users can update their avatars
-- Target roles: authenticated
-- Policy: UPDATE
-- Expression:
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

#### Policy 4: Allow Users to Delete Their Own
```sql
-- Name: Users can delete their avatars
-- Target roles: authenticated
-- Policy: DELETE
-- Expression:
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

### Quick Setup (Simpler Option)

If policies are confusing, just:
1. Create the `avatars` bucket
2. Make it **Public** ✅
3. That's it! (Policies can be added later for more security)

## How to Test

### 1. Make Sure You're Logged In
- Go to `/login`
- Login with your account
- You should see your name in the topbar

### 2. Test Profile Picture
1. Click your name → **Profile Settings**
2. Click the edit icon on the profile picture
3. Select an image file (< 5MB)
4. Click **Save Picture**
5. ✅ Should upload and show in topbar immediately!

### 3. Test Profile Update
1. Click **Edit** on Profile Information
2. Change your display name
3. Click **Save Changes**
4. ✅ Should update in topbar immediately!

### 4. Test Password Change
1. Click **Change** on Change Password
2. Enter current password
3. Enter new password (twice)
4. Click **Change Password**
5. ✅ Should show success message!

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **No API Routes Needed** - Simpler code
✅ **Direct Supabase Integration** - Recommended by Supabase
✅ **Faster** - No API middleman
✅ **Easier to Debug** - Clear error messages
✅ **More Secure** - Uses Supabase's built-in auth
✅ **Real-time Updates** - UI updates immediately

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to upload image"
**Solution:**
- Make sure `avatars` bucket exists in Supabase
- Make sure bucket is set to **Public**
- Check file is under 5MB
- Verify it's an image file

### Issue: "Not authenticated"
**Solution:**
- Logout and login again
- Clear browser cache
- Check `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials

### Issue: Profile picture shows broken image
**Solution:**
- Check if the `avatars` bucket is set to **Public**
- Verify the file uploaded successfully in Supabase Storage
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue: Can't update profile
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection is working

## Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## No More API Routes Needed!

The following API routes are **no longer used** (you can delete them if you want):
- ❌ `/api/auth/update-profile/route.ts`
- ❌ `/api/auth/change-password/route.ts`
- ❌ `/api/auth/update-profile-picture/route.ts`

Everything is handled directly with Supabase now! 🎉

## Try It Now!

1. ✅ Create the `avatars` bucket in Supabase (make it public)
2. ✅ Login to your app
3. ✅ Go to Profile Settings
4. ✅ Try uploading a profile picture
5. ✅ Should work perfectly!

---

**The "Not authenticated" error should be completely gone now!** 🎉

All profile operations work directly with Supabase, which is much more reliable and the recommended approach.
